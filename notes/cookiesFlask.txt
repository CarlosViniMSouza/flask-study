A Request object contains a cookieâ€™s attribute. It is a dictionary object of all the cookie variables and their corresponding values, a client has transmitted. In addition to it, a cookie also stores its expiry time, path and domain name of the site.

In Flask, cookies are set on response object. Use make_response() function to get response object from return value of a view function. After that, use the set_cookie() function of response object to store a cookie.

Reading back a cookie is easy. The get() method of request.cookies attribute is used to read a cookie.
